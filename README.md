## Overview

This project presents a **reliability-aware and explainable machine learning framework** for predicting vehicular accident severity using large-scale traffic data.

Unlike conventional classification systems that focus solely on accuracy, this framework integrates:

- Probabilistic machine learning
- Reliability estimation through the Relative Reliability Index (RRI)
- Deterministic safety rules for fail-safe behavior
- Explainable safety recommendations
- Cross-region robustness evaluation

The framework was developed using a post-pandemic subset of the **US Accidents Dataset (2021–2023)** containing approximately **500,000 records**.

---

## Key Features

- **Accident severity prediction**
- **Relative Reliability Index (RRI)** for uncertainty-aware inference
- **Hybrid architecture combining ML and rule-based safety logic**
- **Explainable safety recommendations**
- **Cross-state robustness validation across 50 U.S. states**
- **Feature importance and SHAP analysis**
- **Fast inference (~3 ms/sample)**

## Dataset

**Source:** US Accidents Dataset

**Period Used:** 2021–2023

**Records:** ~500,000

### Features

- Visibility
- Temperature
- Weather conditions
- Hour of day
- Weekday
- Regional clusters

### Target Classes

| Severity | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Low |
| 2 | Moderate |
| 3 | High |
| 4 | Critical |

## Relative Reliability Index (RRI)

Traditional models often produce overconfident predictions.

This framework introduces the **Relative Reliability Index (RRI)**, which transforms model confidence into a bounded risk score:

RRI = 0 if P < Pmin
RRI = normalized if Pmin ≤ P < Pmax
RRI = 100 if P ≥ Pmax


The RRI provides:

- Better uncertainty interpretation
- Conservative risk signaling
- Improved edge-case awareness
- Fail-safe decision support

## Models Evaluated

| Model | Accuracy | Weighted F1 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Random Forest (Proposed) | 88.03% | 84.68% |
| SVM | 90.21% | 85.57% |
| AdaBoost | 90.21% | 85.57% |
| MLP | 90.00% | 85.00% |
| XGBoost + SMOTE | 85.00% | 83.00% |

Although several models achieved slightly higher accuracy, Random Forest was selected due to:

- Better stability
- Higher interpretability
- Probability outputs enabling reliability-aware inference
- Compatibility with deterministic safety rules
